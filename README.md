#Troubadour 

A modern day problem that many people face is having to endure a party hostâ€™s ***terrible*** taste in music. Troubadour seeks to give users a comprehensive solution to this by generating an optimized playlist based off nearby users' preferences. This will be done by passing the preferences to the Spotify API which will return a generated playlist the host can play.

##Quick-Start Guide
